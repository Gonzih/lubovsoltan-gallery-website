	<p class="bio-pic"><img src="Website/lubov_soltan_bio.jpg" alt="Lubov Soltan" /></p>

	<p>
		Belarusian-born student of Fine Art, who favours the malleable nature of oil painting. Drawing
		inspiration from the volatility of the human condition and the varied places she’s called home,
		Lubov’s subject matter fittingly ranges from the romantic rainy cityscapes of Toronto Old Town
		to the dark and ethereal inner worlds of the soul.
	</p>

	<p>
		After exhibiting in her hometown Lubov became immersed in the world of tech and design, a career
		that drew her first across Europe then to Toronto, and inspired a passion for graphic art along
		the way.
	</p>

	<p>
		Now an established Product Designer in Vancouver, Canada, she is keen to rekindle her “artist
		origin story” and once again explore more tactile mediums.
